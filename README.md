# Sinhala Headline Generation
This is a text generation task created with the [NSINA dataset](https://github.com/Sinhala-NLP/NSINA). This dataset is also released with the same license as NSINA. The objective of the task is to generate news headlines based on the provided news content.


## Data
We used the same instances from NSINA 1.0 as all the news articles had headlines. We divided this dataset into a training and test set following a 0.8 split. 
Data can be loaded into pandas dataframes using the following code. 

```python
from datasets import Dataset
from datasets import load_dataset

train = Dataset.to_pandas(load_dataset('sinhala-nlp/NSINA-Headlines', split='train'))
test = Dataset.to_pandas(load_dataset('sinhala-nlp/NSINA-Headlines', split='test'))
```
